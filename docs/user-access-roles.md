# User Access and Role-based Experience

## Overview

The SmartCart platform implements a comprehensive user access system that supports two distinct user types: regular customers and store administrators. This role-based approach ensures that each user has access to appropriate functionality while maintaining security and providing a focused experience.

## User Types and Roles

**Primary Function**: Shopping and purchasing products

**Core Capabilities**:
- Browse product catalog
- Search and filter products
- Add items to shopping cart
- Manage cart contents (view, update quantities, remove items)
- Complete checkout process
- View order confirmation

**Access Permissions**:
- Public product browsing (may not require authentication)
- Personal cart management (session-based or authenticated)
- Checkout and order placement (requires customer information)

### 2. Store Administrator Role
**Primary Function**: Platform and business management

**Core Capabilities**:

## Security Requirements

### Authentication

## User Experience Design

## Implementation Considerations

### Frontend Requirements

- Protected routes for administrative areas
- User state management
- Responsive design for both user types

### Backend Requirements
- User authentication and session management

## User Workflow Examples

### Customer Workflow
1. Access platform (guest or authenticated)
2. Browse products and add to cart
3. Proceed to checkout
4. Provide necessary information
5. Complete order and receive confirmation

### Administrator Workflow
1. Secure login to administrative interface
2. Review pending orders and inventory status

This role-based system ensures that SmartCart provides appropriate functionality to each user type while maintaining security and operational efficiency.
